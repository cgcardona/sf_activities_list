# San Francisco Activities List

## Summary

An online friend recently told me that they are coming to [San Francisco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) for a
week and asked for some suggestions of things to do. 

I figured the best way to handle this would be to outsource it as well as create
a github repo so that anyone can improve the list. So if you know of something
cool and don't see it on here please add it or if you see something wrong fix it.
